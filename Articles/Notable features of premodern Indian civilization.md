Upinder Singh has a book titled _Ancient India: Culture of Contradictions_. Owing to her left slant, the themes she focused on were anachronistic and basic (”misogyny”, “goddess worship”, “inequality” etc.) but I thought the idea was a good one, and better-chosen themes would help highlight the notable features of Indian civilization and the depth and variance of Ancient Indian thought.

- Truth vs cunning
- Artha Materialism vs emphasis on eternal
- Centrality of wealth vs voluntary poverty
- Chastity vs courtesan culture
- Sensual restraint vs indulgence

Kṛṣṇadevarāya’s Āmuktamālyada 278

The king is non-violent, though he kills.

Chaste, though he has women.

Truthful, though he lies.

Ever fasting, though he eats well.

A hero, though he uses trickery.

Rich, though he gives away.

Kingship is rather strange.
