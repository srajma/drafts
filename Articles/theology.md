# Early Vedic society and theological developments

The history of Hinduism — and the cultural history of India at large — is the history of assimilation.

The culture of the ancient Vedic elites occupies the dominant role in our understanding of Indian history due to their superiority in transmitting knowledge and their cosmopolitanism; however, throughout time there have been distinct cultures on this land, whose histories are shrouded in relative mystery, but which were eventually syncretized into the great alloy that is the Indian ethos of today.

This is a topic that gets a lot of unwanted attention from half-witted “sub-nationalist/separatist” (i.e. Periyarist, Ambedkarite, Khalistani, caste kangers) movements: these people’s historical knowledge is limited to idiotic interpretations of a few popular myths (”Vāmana-Bali/Mahiśāsura is about Aryans and Dravidians”, “Mohini/Ardhanārīśvara is about LGBT”). These crackpot delusions are anachronistic projections of simplistic racial narratives on the past, yet often obtain approval from mainstream writers due to the unholy leftist-subnat alliance. However, they are easily washed away with a rational and dispassionate analysis of the topic, which is what we will do here.

The history of Indian theology is however a rather vast topic, and this article only provides a broad overview. For those who want to read precise details, the undisputed living expert on this topic is mānasa-taraṃgiṇī ([blog](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/the-complete-index/), [theology](theology.md)).

## Early Vedic outgroups

Early Vedic literature mentions a number of outgroups — noobs often incorrectly map this onto “Aryan” and “Dravidian” (categorizations which do not reflect how people in the Vedic era saw themselves), so it is important to more reasonably identify who these groups were.

**List**

- **Dasyu** — an Iranian people; presumably they were defeated and mass-enslaved in some war, leading to their ethnonym becoming synonymous for “servant”. See Encyclopedia Iranica’s entry on Dahyu [1x.1], and this Stack Exchange answer [1x.2] refuting claims that they were of dark complexion.
- **Mleccha** — the earliest mention of this is from [Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3.2.1.23-24](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/satapatha-brahmana-sanskrit/d/doc1052498.html), which contains a sample of Mleccha speech (”he ‘lavah! he ‘lavah!”), and generally referred to an unintelligible language (due to the importance of precision of speech to the Ārya identity, it became a generic out-group identifier, like “barbarian”). (Etymology unclear; it may be related to “Meluḫḫa⁠”, the Mesopotamian word for the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), but in this case I would speculate that the term really originated from an IVC term for the Baloch highlands, and was used for the IVC as a whole by the Mesopotamians due to its proximity to them)
- **Paṇi** — a wealthy mercantile people, derided for their wealth in the Ṛg Veda but assimilated as Vaiśyas via the creation of the caste system in the Post-RV period (1000—800 BC). The term itself is cognate with Norse “Vanir”, the gods of commerce, similarly derided.
- **Śiśnadeva** — phallus-worshippers in the Ṛg Veda, probably a precursor to Lingam-worship. Later commentaries interpret the term instead as “unchaste people”.
- **Nāga** — the term nāga itself is not mentioned in Vedic literature, (the Mahābhārata is first to use it), but the Vedic literature extensively speaks of a cult of _sarpasatra_, “The Serpent Sacrifice”, which may variously refer to a sacrifice _by_ serpents, _of_ serpents, or _to_ serpents. A comprehensive source on this is [[2] van den Hoek & Shrestha (1992), “The Sacrifice of Serpents: Exchange and Non-Exchange in the Sarpabali of Indrāyaṇī, Kathmandu”](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43715700).
- **Vrātya** — fierce wandering ascetics; they were undoubtedly precursor to the Śaivite sect (they are mentioned in conjunction with deities such as Rudra and Paśupati) as well as to the ascetic (śramaṇa) influences on [philosophy](philosophy.md). A comprehensive source on this is [[3] ”Who were the Vrātyas?” by Sreenivas Rao](https://sreenivasaraos.com/2012/09/13/who-were-the-vratyas-the-searching-wanderers/).
- **Niṣāda** — a tribe that was “neither forest-dwelling nor settled” and were eventually assimilated into Vedic society, part of them Sanskritized into fully-enfranchised Āryas, part remained untouchable, and part expelled to frontier regions in the South and the East; see [4](4)(https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.150465/page/n67/mode/2up) and also later-cited [6x.1] which claims them to be related to the modern Nihali people.

**Speculative claims about Paṇis:**

The revival of many IVC traditions in the Second Urbanization (800 BC onward) is well-known, e.g.

- Units of mass: the classical Indian unit of mass is the _ratti_, the weight of a gunja seed ~0.113g. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa which mentions a unit called the Śatamāna which is 100 kṛṣṇalās, and the kṛṣṇalā is [widely](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/krishnala) attested by later literature to be the same as a ratti; Gandharan coins from the Second Urbanization up to the time of Kautilya measure 100 rattis; the Kārṣāpaṇa itself is 32 rattis; the Arthaśāstra claims the _purāṇa_ or “old” system of measurement had a standard of 32 rattis but proposes instead an 80-ratti standard called _svarṇa_ which was use from Mauryan times onwards. Now what’s interesting is that the IVC weights belonged to a binary scale 1:2:4:8:16:32 where the smallest weight coincided with exactly 8 rattis, and the most commonly used weight was scale 4, i.e. 32 rattis, exactly what the Arthaśāstra calls the old system of measurement. Sources: [5x.1-2]
- Units of length: An ivory scale from Lothal has decimal divisions with each graduation of length 1.7mm, ten of these graduations equals the aṅgula according to the Arthaśāstra and such. Sources: [5x.3-5].
- Symbols on coinage: The Mohenjodaro class IV silver pieces and class D pieces are “remarkably similar” to later punch-marked coins [5x.6], and the symbols on IVC _seals_ famously bear close resemblance to punch-marked coins [5x.7]. It is worth noting is that the IVC had “metals of fixed weight” for commerce, i.e. bullion/coins but without stamping [5x.8-13], and that the Ṛg Veda itself mentions the term _niṣka_, which was at least later used to refer to coins explicitly, and even the Rig Veda use is suggestive (e.g. RV [4.37.4](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/rig-veda-english-translation/d/doc830255.html), [1.126.2](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/rig-veda-english-translation/d/doc830255.html)) although the unambiguous use of the term to refer to currency only appears in Maṇdala 1 which was composed later (1000—800 BC). For a contrary perspective, see Cunningham [5x.14] who believes the weight of a kārṣāpaṇa coincided with that of the Phonecian shekel and thus derived from it.
- Misc: ivory dice, baked brick construction, bangles, generally similar craft industries, baths and stepwells, Yoga and meditative practices (if the so-called Paśupati seal is to be regarded as evidence for such). Sources: [5x.15].

Based on the especial prominence of activities related to trade and finance in these, and the fact that modern _baniya_ (mercantile) castes have the greatest proportion of IVC ancestry, I am inclined to suggest that the Paṇi were the descendants of the IVC mercantile elite who preserved various IVC traditions and crafts into the Vedic period. Note also the similarity between the terms _paṇi_ and _paṇa_ and the derivation _paṇi_ → _vaṇij_ → _baniya_.

The comprehensive resource on this topic is [[5] SC Malik (1968), Indian Civilization: the formative period](https://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.107464/page/129/mode/2up), who postulates a similar theory. However, note that the book does make some mistakes, such as claiming the word _pura_ has no Indo-European cognate (the Greek cognate is _polis_).

**Speculative comments about Nāgas:**

You will often see claims variously associating the Nāgas with tribes in Northeast India, Southeast Asia or Central-East India. Certainly, the term was later used to describe these tribes, but is quite absurd to claim that they all belonged to some widespread “Nāga culture”.

Instead, it seems to me that the Nāgas were a _symbol of Hindu assimilation_: a label assigned to any people who were initially foreign and hostile to the Āryas but eventually yielding to our ways. Of course, the motif would have been based on a real serpent-worshipping culture in the time of the Kuru kingdom (1000—900 BC), who were initially hostile to the Kurus but eventually made peace with them and assimilated culturally, as attested in the Mahābhārata in the story of Janamejaya and Takṣaka.

(Note that I am willing to accept the Mahābhārata for information on the Vedic period despite its varied period of composition ~1000 BC—400, because e.g. the sarpasatra is independently attested by Vedic literature without appearing to have been copied.)

**Note on demons:**

Sub-nat circles suffer from the Euhemeristic tendency of believing every mythic or legendary race of “demons” must be based on some race of people (invariably their own), e.g. Asura, Daitya, Dānava, Rākṣasa, Yakṣa. None of these are of Euhemeristic origin: _Asura_ was a generic honorific for a powerful being like “Lord” and grew a negative connotation due to the popularity of David-vs-Goliath-style storytelling; this was _not_ due to some conflict against the Zoroastrians, who simply retained the positive meaning of _Asura_ (however, the Zoroastrian rejection of the _Devas_ as demons _was_ due to their dissent from the prevailing Vedic or para-Vedic culture in their early homeland in Afghanistan). The term _Rākṣasa_ first appears in the epics, and based on its etymology (”protector”) could have either have been motivated by wild tribes protecting forests from the light of civilization or by guards of castles and treasures in heroic mythology. Alternatively they could be based on the Rakṣas people of Baluchistan mentioned by Pāṇini 5.3.117 (see VS Agarwala). _Dānava_ frequently occurs in the Ṛg Veda; both only appear in the Purāṇas; _Daitya_ appears in classical texts such as the Manusmṛiti only as celestial beings without any further negative connotation, both are purely mythical beings from their very conception. _Yakṣa_ is a minor nature spirit in the Ṛg Veda itself, a similar class of beings as the _Gandharva_, etc.

## Speculation on pre-Mauryan archaeological cultures

All the aforementioned groups mentioned lived in the same geographic region as the Vedic people, i.e. Udīchya+Brahmāvarta+Madhyadeśa (Punjab+Haryana+UP) — except the Vrātyas who in the latter Vedic period settled the Magadha region (see source [3]), and perhaps the Mlecchas who I might have been of Sindh or the Baloch highlands. What, then, were the religions and cultures in the rest of the Loka, pre-Maurya?

**Language distribution:** One piece of information is the current distribution of languages, which suggests a peninsular distribution of the Dravidian languages, Eastern distribution of Munda (Austro-asiatic), and the language isolates of Nihali, Burushaki, Kusunda and the remnants in Vedda, which may at one point have had a wider distribution.

![language families today.png](language%20families%20today.png)

Image: [arxiv.org/pdf/2203.12524.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.12524.pdf)

**Substrate identification:** However, it is quite difficult to imagine that e.g. Dravidian could have had such a wide geographical distribution in neolithic/chalcolithic times, and this also doesn’t answer any question about the “pre-Aryan” languages in the North, or the language of the IVC. Certainly if we are willing to entertain that Nihali could have once had a wider distribution, then so could any language completely lost to us today. To have any shot at answering these questions, one must study _substrates_ in extant languages: words in the language not attested in any cognate language, and which share some structure. Hypothesized substrates in Vedic Sanskrit:

1. _“para-Munda” substrate_ of Witzel [6x.1], characterized by words prefixed by k- such as even _kumāra_, names of plants and animals, names of many major rivers including the Gaṅgā, names of early chieftains in Punjab, names associated with the Kīkaṭa and Khāṇḍava, names of Eastern provinces ending in -ṅga (Aṅga, Vaṅga, Kaliṅga, Teliṅga)
2. _“language X”_ of Masica’s [6x.2], consisting of names of plants in the Gangetic plains
3. _“Indo-Iranian substrate”_ of Lubotsky’s [6x.3], consisting of words related to construction, camel (_ustra_) and even significant religious words like _indra_, _atharva_, _gandharva_.
4. _Dravidian substrate_, discussed by Zvelebil [6x.4]; according to Witzel only appears in the middle RV period, and Dravidian was spoken in Sindh and Baluchistan
5. _“Meluhhan substrate”_, which according to Witzel was spoken in IVC Sindh before the migration of Dravidians (from Baluchistan according to him, but I think could also be from the South)
6. _Tibeto-Burman substrate_, according to Witzel, existed in the Kosala region.

Also worthy of note is the “Inner-Outer hypothesis” of e.g. Zoller [6x.5] (see also the comments by mānasataraṃgiṇī therein) which postulates two waves of Aryan migrations into India, one with more archaic Indo-Iranic features, preserved in the North-West, and another a standard Indo-Aryan one.

**Mālaya tribe:** The talk of a “para-Munda” language in Punjab may strike one as odd given its generally presumed Eastern provenance (indeed, Munda resurfaces in the names of Eastern provinces). However, a major Austro-asiatic presence has been noted by several authors including:

[[7.1] PC Bagchi (1929), “Pre-Aryan And Pre-Dravidian in India”](https://archive.org/details/prearyanandpredravidianindiaprabodhchandrabagchi1993_431_i/page/n9/mode/2up)

[[7.2] RC Majumdar (1937), Ancient Indian colonies in the Far East: Vol II (Suvarnadvipa), Part I (Political History). pgs 19-24.](https://www.vifindia.org/sites/default/files/145639880-Ancient-Indian-Colonies-in-the-Far-East-1937.pdf) ([my comments thereon](https://twitter.com/real_mahalingam/status/1692464518377377843))

[[7.3] Joseph Minattur (1966), "Malaya: What's in a name?”](https://thesiamsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/1966/03/JSS_054_1c_Minattur_MalayaWhatsInAName.pdf)

E.g. Majumdar suggests that the various Mālayas:

- the Mālava tribe of Punjab that migrated to Ujjain or vice versa (attested as Mālaya in some coins, this is a standard sound change), and the related name “Malwa” for the Ujjain region
- the Dravidian term _mala_ for mountain, preserved in the name “Mālaya” in Sanskrit literature for the Southern part of the Western ghats, and in the names Malayāḷam and Malabar for Kerala
- Malayaketu of the Mudra-Rākṣasa (interestingly the son of _Parvataka_, thus associated with mountains), Malayāvati the wife of the Kuntala king Śātakarṇi Sātavāhana in the [Kāmasūtra](https://sacred-texts.com/sex/kama/kama207.htm)
- Various Southeast Asian Malayas: Malaysia (Malayu, Malacca), Malayu in Sumatra, Māla or Mālava for Laos, Molucca islands in Eastern Indonesia
- Maldives (Māladvipa), Madagascar (whose people are known as Malagasy)
- (Majumdar doesn’t claim this) Perhaps even Meluḫḫa⁠?

Are related, and that the tribe is of Austro-asiatic, i.e. “Para-Munda” origin.

**Fish-eater colonialism:** However incredible this claim of a great lost civilization spanning the seas in the LBA/EIA may seem, there is a third context wherein it has independently arisen, namely the early trade between the Indian West coast (both IVC Gujarat and the Konkan, Karnataka) and Sub-Saharan Africa [8x.1] [8x.2] and the mastery over the monsoon winds:

[[8] Dorian Fuller (2009), “Crops, cattle and commensals across the Indian Ocean” (see paragraph labeled 32)](https://journals.openedition.org/oceanindien/698)

**Material cultures:** Perhaps we can get some hints from looking at archaeology? Here is a list of material cultures from North India known to archaeologists:

![archaeological cultures.png](archaeological%20cultures.png)

Table S1 of [9x.1]

In the Deccan you have the famous megalithic culture (dolmens and such) and ashmounds, which I cannot even find reliable dating for, and in the Tamil country you have sites at Keezhadi, Adichanallur, Anuradhapura etc. But this is all really disappointingly unexplored and doesn’t help us, though it is notable that the only clear examples we have of material cultures ~1300—800BC outside the Vedic realm are those of Madhya Pradesh, something also attested in e.g. the famous Bhimbetka caves. Indeed, even in the literature one observes the culture of the Pulindas is mentioned somewhat distinctly, e.g. [9x.2].

**The Rāmāyaṇa**

The Rāmāyaṇa appears to be based on a combination of real events of importance from the 8th or 7th centuries BC as well as an account of information from the earliest Ārya explorations of the peninsula (similar in mystique to e.g. the accounts of Indica by Herodotus or Ctesias). If you accept this general view, then the ambiguous names in the Rāmāyaṇa can be seen as a sample of words or names in the peninsula in those times: Hanumān, Vālī, Rāvaṇa, , Jaṭāyu, Sampāti, Kiṣkindhā, Rumā, Khara (note the name of later Kaliṅga king Kharavela), Mālyavān & related Māli, Mārīca, Śabarī (perhaps from the river Śabarī, a tributary to the Godāvarī), Tāṭakā (the yakṣa).

I think that in cases where a place is said to be named after a character, it is likely to be the reverse. E.g. according to [10x.1], the Śabarī river is named after the “Śabara”, a Telugu people; or the tale of Takṣaka in the Mahābhārata indicating a Nāga culture in Gandhāra before the dominance of the Kurus, or the tale of Mahiṣāsura for Mysore, of Vātāpi, of Śūrpaṇakhā based on the city of Śūrparaka. Their true etymology may lie in some (lost?) peninsular language.

(There have been some claims that the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa actually does not refer to an expedition to the South, that Laṅka is actually in Amarakaṇṭaka in Madhya Pradesh and that its identification with Siṃhala comes from the period of the Cōḻa imperialism in the island. This is definitively false: [Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa 4.41](http://www.valmikiramayan.net/utf8/kish/sarga41/kishkindha_41_frame.htm) identifies the location of Laṅkā as being in the South, past the Pāṇdya country, opposite the ocean from the Mahendra mountains (Eastern Ghats): this can only be Sri Lanka. Besides, the Rāmāyaṇa is quite explicit in its geography, describing an overall Southern voyage, e.g. Pañcavaṭī forest, the site of Sītā’s abduction, is on the Godāvari river ([Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa 3.64](http://www.valmikiramayan.net/aranya/sarga64/aranya_64_frame.htm)) and probably identifiable as Nashik. In the 4th century, the Laṇkāvatāra Sūtra, a Bauddha text, was composed in Siṃhala itself.)

## Theological developments c. 500 BC to classical

The culmination of the theology of the previous period is the [Bṛhaddevatā](https://archive.org/details/bhaddevat01univgoog/page/n14/mode/2up), c. 500 BC. Subsequently many theological cults developed, some absorbing non-Vedic elements from the Vrātyas, Nāgas etc. some canonizing the songs of bards (the _Sūta_ caste), and some independent developments.

**The Bhagavata sect**

**The Śaiva sect**

**The Sūta literature**

**Śramaṇa sects of note**

**The Hindu Cosmology**

seven continents, origin stories, yugas, manu, saptarsi, kasyapa, heaven vs reincarnation

- Bauddha, Jaina and Sangam theology
- Canonical and post-canonical (Tantra, Bhakti, Purana) theology
