# A short bibiliography of good sources for Indian history

A general word of advice that will serve you well in life: the most popular commentators, books, the most public-facing intellectuals are usually _not_ the best in their fields, nor are they the best to learn from. Here’s what [libertarian economist Bryan Caplan](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2012/03/my_beautiful_bu.html) had to say in a different context:

> In my world, Alex Tabarrok is more important than Barack Obama, Robin Hanson is more important than Paul Krugman, and the late Gary Gygax is more important than Jeremy Lin… whoever that might be.

In your dabbling in Indian history, Ananda Coomaraswamy should be far bigger than Romila Thapar; various Twitter anons should be far bigger than Sanjeev Sanyal; zinc smelting should be bigger of a “great Indian invention” than the number 0 or shampoo; the private corporation should be a more important aspect of ancient Indian society than glorification of kings and dynasties, epistemology, the Puruṣārtha and “restraint over the senses” should be bigger themes of Indian philosophy than anachronistic projections of LGBT/environmentalism/nationalism onto the ancients.

A common error in Indian history discussions is the _argument from ignorance_: making confident assertions about the absence of something without having comprehensively searched for it. This has a dangerous self-reinforcing effect, because history academia has a stupid norm of preferring more recent and tertiary sources, deeming old sources outdated and secondary sources non-notable: so when modern writers are poorly-read in the works of their superiors before them, those works become lost _forever_.

This post provides a bibiliography of high-quality, information-dense books on Indian history (1200 BC—1200). Let me know of any recommendations to add! The very first book I would start with is Moti Chandra: his information-density beats everything else on this list; you will learn a _lot_.
