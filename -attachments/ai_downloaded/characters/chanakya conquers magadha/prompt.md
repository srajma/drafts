Illustrate a 2D black and white comic-style epic painting named 'THE CONQUEST OF MAGADHI'. Focus on the two key figures almost filling the foreground, in passionate embrace: a handsome ambitious Vedic boy with flowing hair from his hair bun, grabbing the fierce dark-skinned goddess Magadhi by the waist as she looks up at him defiantly, their faces inches from meeting. She is clad in white robes with red fringes, a black headband, and she drops her trident and bow as he grabs her. In the background, five separate Hindu river goddesses with swirling water-like bodies, seemingly small and insignificant, look up at them with desire and fascination. The backdrop is the backdrop of a vast ancient city of wooden pillars and arches laid to waste by fire, war, and destruction.
