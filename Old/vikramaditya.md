The Maurya-Gupta interregnum (180 BC -- 250 AD), in particular the
period 57 BC -- 78 AD, was a giant mess when it comes to the history of
North-Western India.

South India under the Satavahanas and North India under the Shungas and
successive Magadhan dynasties prospered in this period under relatively
stable Vedic governance. In the North-West, however, the situation could
only be described as political *chaos*.

There is already confusion about the political history in the period of
Greco-Bactrian invasions before 57 BC[^1], and during the period of
Scythian invasions, sovereignty was fuzzy and fluctuating, borders were
non-constant or even ill-defined, and the chronology is highly
uncertain. It would perhaps be most accurate to refer to the period as a
complex multipartite war between the Greco-Bactrians, Scythians,
Parthians, Yuezhi and local and imperial Indic states.

In the midst of all this chaos, there is one name that shines most
brightly: Vikramaditya of Ujjain -- who, as per traditional record,
emerged victorious over the invaders and established a glorious golden
age of prosperity and governance in accordance with Vedic laws. His
victory over the Scythians c. 57 BC marks the epoch of the Vikrama
Samvat, the traditional Hindu calendar -- and his name was immortalized
by history as a regal title, equivalent to "Caesar" in Europe or
"Alexander" in Persia.

The purpose of this text is to reconstruct a precise history of the
period between 57 BC -- 78 AD based on the primary sources available to
us.

If you're unfamiliar with the historical context, read the background
chapters first.

**Historicity of Vikramaditya**

The most informative secondary source I found on this matter is Luniya
(1972)[^2] (quick popular summary[^3]), which is comprehensive. I will
reproduce his arguments below.

Historians claim that the Vikrama Calendar (the most obvious evidence in
favor of Vikramaditya's historicity) doesn't appear until the year 737,
well after the end of the Gupta period.

However, this is only true in a very technical sense. The *Yupa*
inscriptions[^4], made between the 3rd and 5th centuries, are all dated
based on an era beginning in 57 BC called the *Krta* era:

-   The Nandsa sacrificial pillar, dated to Krta year 282[^5]

-   The Badwa sacrificial pillar, dated to Krta year 295[^6]

-   The Barnala sacrificial inscriptions, dated to Krta year 284 and
    335[^7]

-   The Vijaygarh inscriptions, dated to Krta year 428

-   The Mandsour inscription, dated to Krta year 461 \[alongside later
    inscriptions\]

-   The Gangadhara inscription, dated to Krta year 480

-   The Nagari inscription, dated to Krta year 481 \[alongside earlier
    inscriptions\]

Then between the 5th and 10th centuries, the same era appears under the
name of the *Malava* era:

-   The Mandsour inscription of 461 refers to the era as both Krta and
    Malava[^8]

-   The Mandsour inscription of Kumaragupta, dated in the era of the
    Malava Republic

-   The Mandsour inscription of Yashodharman, dated in the era of the
    Malava Republic year 589

-   The Kanaswa inscription of Sivagana, dated to Malava year 795[^9]

-   The Gyaraspur inscription, dated to Malava year 936[^10]

And finally inscriptions from the 9th century on use the term *Vikrama*
era:

-   The Ahara inscription of Allata, dated to Vikrama year 810

-   The Dhaulpur inscription of Chanda-Mahasena, dated to Vikrama year
    973

-   The Bijapur inscription of the Rashtrakuta Vidagdharaja, dated to
    Vikrama year 973

-   A Bodhagaya inscription, dated to Vikrama year 1005

-   The Ekalingaji inscription of Naravahan, dated to Vikrama year 1028

-   The Vasantagadh inscription of Purnapala, dated to Vikrama year 1099

This establishes a cultural continuity in the use of the era -- It's far
harder to accept that people in 225 were ignorant of the events of 57
BC, than that people in 810 were. Also, since the earliest appearances
of the Krta era predate Chandragupta II, the theory that Vikramaditya is
entirely a character based on Chandragupta II is demonstrably false.

Luniya has an interesting theory for the change of terminology: he
suggests that the earlier omission of the personal name from the name of
the era is a result of the republican nature of the Malavas;
Vikramaditya was the chief of a republic, rather than a king, and thus
their victory would not be attributed to him alone. Once this republican
origin was forgotten, Vikramaditya received individual veneration.

Of course, this is speculative, but it would also resolve the other
argument against Vikramaditya's historicity: his apparent omission from
dynastic histories in the Puranas. Luniya points out that the
Puranas[^11] *do* mention the Gardabhila dynasty, a house of the
Malavas, which later Jain literature associates with Vikramaditya.

Historians claim that there is no numismatic evidence for Vikramaditya.
This appears to just be blatantly false on multiple levels. First, early
Indian coins (until Vasishthiputra Pulumavi, c. 100 AD) did not carry
legends or kings' portraits, but instead simple geometric designs.
Second, hordes of unidentified coins have been found from the period,
including at Ujjain. In particular, more than 6000 coins have been found
at Malavanagara[^12] \-- one group of such coins explicitly bears one of
two Brahmi legends:

*Malavanam Jayah*

(The victory of the Malavas)

And:

*Malava Ganasya Jayah*

(The victory of the Malava Republic)

Some of these coins contain a king's portrait, the others have a vase,
lion, bull, fan-tail-peacock, etc. as the reverse design.

For completeness I will mention that there are also some bolder claims
from more recent times[^13], claiming to have found coins with a
portrait of Vikramaditya; these appear to me as unreliable at least in
their reporting.

Even in the absence of such explicitly positive evidence, there would
have been reason to believe the historicity of Vikramaditya; namely, the
radical change in the culture of the Scythians between 57 BC and 78 AD,
which is likely to be attributed to powerful influence from Ujjain. In
particular, the Sanskrit epigraphy that the Indo-Scythians later became
famous for has its roots in earlier Malava Sanskrit epigraphy (namely
the Hathibada Ghosundi inscriptions[^14]).

Thus all that needs to be ascertained is the precise level of power and
territorial extent the Malavas had through this period.

**Reconstructing the period 57 BC -- 78 AD**

(Again, if you are not familiar with the background of the
Greco-Bactrian and other invasions of India starting 180 BC, I suggest
reading the background sections first.)

We will first list the important primary-sourced facts based on which we
will make our inferences:

-   The Scythian invader Maues had overstruck of the coins of the
    Indo-Greek Archebius in Taxila.

-   An Indo-Greek coin bearing the inscription "*rajatirajasa moasa
    putrasa (ca) artemidorosa*", reading either as "Maues's son
    Artemidoros" or "Maues and the son of Artemidoros"; in either case,
    Maues allied with at least some Indo-Greek houses.

-   The Parthian Vonones of Sakastan briefly occupied Taxila during
    Maues's reign, as evidenced by his coinage.

-   Vonones's successors Spalahores and Spalirisos were both Scythians,
    and did not occupy Taxila; thus various Parthian and Scythian houses
    were allied or even mixed in their invasion of India.

-   Indo-Greek Apollodotus II later overstruck Maues's coins in Taxila,
    probably after Maues's death.

-   The Indo-Scythian Azes ruled Taxila sometime after these early
    Parthians, and overstruck the Greek coins. His successor was
    Azilises.

-   The Apracharajas who ruled from Bajaur (a little North of Taxila)
    seemed to be much more Indian, although they are typically
    classified as Indo-Scythian. They were probably descended from the
    Vedic Ashvakas (based on their name and their region); their rulers'
    names are very Indic; their language, script and philosophies appear
    to have been Indic. The names of some Queen consorts are more
    Iranian, however, and they feature some Greek deities on their
    coins, so they may have mixed with Scythians and Greeks. Their
    territory probably did not extend much beyond Taxila.

-   Zeionises ruled from West of Taxila, contemporary to some of the
    Apracharajas, and may have briefly occupied it. His successor was
    Kharahostes, who was apparently allied with the Apracharajas[^15] as
    suggested by the Silver Reliquary of Indravarman, so it is possible
    these were simply allied houses that ruled Taxila jointly in a
    republican fashion. The Mathura Lion Capital inscription refers to
    this house as Kamuia, which may be Kamboja (which would again
    suggest significant mixing between such tribes).

-   The Indo-Parthian Gondophares certainly occupied Taxila at some
    point, it was their capital; they're often held to have ruled the
    entirety of territory from Sakala to Sindh, but these are probably
    fanciful accounts based on Philostratus's unreliable *Life of
    Apollonius Tyana*.

-   Kharahostes's son Mujatria and the Apraca ruler Sasan were again
    sovereign, and are known to be contemporary with the Kushan invader
    Kujula Kadphises (45---50 AD) based on hoard finds and overstrikes
    on Mujatria's coins by Kujula's successor Vima Takto.

-   But the Indo-Parthian Abdagases I (45---60 AD) *also* issued coins
    at Taxila[^16]. So again, battlefield. Or vassals, but this seems
    unlikely.

-   The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (c. 70---80 AD) attests a
    Scythian kingdom in Sindh with Minnagara as its capital, and
    mentions the circulation of coins with Greek legends in
    Bharuch[^17].

-   The Scythians Hagamasha and Hagana are known to have issued coins in
    Mathura at some point, and were called *Kshatrapas*. Rajuvula was
    referred to as a *Mahakshatrapa*. These two may have been
    predecessors of Rajuvula, his successors, or his contemporary
    vassals.

-   There are coins issued by an Indo-Greek ruler Strato II, many of
    which are found alongside Rajuvula's at Sakala and
    Mathura[^18][^19], suggesting that (1) they are contemporaries
    and (2) that the Indo-Greek kingdom rose again at some point between
    20 BC and 10 AD.

-   Sodasa was Rajuvula's son, as per the Mathura lion capital. His
    inscriptions are only found in Mathura, so the Scythian territories
    in Sakala were probably lost again in this period.

-   No Scythian rulers are attested in Mathura from Sodasa c. 15 AD
    until Kharapallana and Vanaspara, vassals of Kanishka I c. 130.

-   Kujula Kadphises issued coins in Taxila[^20][^21].

-   For dating: the Taxila copper plate, suggesting a Maues era starting
    in 72 BC; the Bajaur relinquary inscription, suggesting an Azes era
    starting in 45 BC, and dating the Apracharaja Vijayamitra's reign to
    12 BC -- 20 AD. The precise regnal years of the Apracharajas --
    Vijayamitra, Indravasu, Visnuvarma, Indravarman, Aspavarma, Sasan --
    overlap and are weird as everything else here is. Western records
    clarify Indo-Parthian rule to have began c. 19 AD. Rajuvula's reign
    is pinned down to c. 10 AD by the Mathura lion capital that
    establishes his generational relationship to Kharahostes. Kujula
    Kadiphses is known to have existed c. 70 AD.

I will add some comments about the Scythian rulers of Mathura, aka "The
Northern Satraps".

I find the mainstream data of 60---50 BC for the Scythian conquest of
Mathura to be highly improbable for several reasons: (1) that would mean
stable and long reigns for Hagamasha and Hagana, quite rare in this
chaotic period (2) Strato II's coins at Mathura paint a picture of a
Rajavula invading from the West, rather than his dynasty already having
been established at Mathura. Thus I find it likely that Hagamasha and
Hagana were either vassals of Rajavula, his successors, or minor
Scythian houses that were involved in a multipartite struggle for
Mathura (which succeeded upon Rajavula's ascension) in a short period
before him.

The other question is who these Northern Satraps were Satraps to.
Perhaps they were satraps to the Scythians at Taxila as mainstream
history holds (this seems unlikely, since Sodasa did not control Sakala
and so this would mean being vassal to a territory he was not contiguous
with) or to some other Indian state, but it seems more likely to me that
they used the terms in a similar manner to the later Western Satraps:
the reigning monarch was called a *Mahakshatrapa*, and his princes were
called *Kshatrapas*.

Here's the whole political history summarized. If anyone has the time to
make an Ollie Bye-style visualization of this, be my guest.

**Aftermath: 78 -- 250**

I will say a couple of things about the Scythian resurgence in the 1st
century.

These Scythians were divided into two houses: the Kshaharatas and the
Kardamakas. The Kshaharatas were Bhumaka and Nahapana; the Kardamakas
included Chastana (crowned 78) and Rudradaman (crowned 130).

It is often said that the Kshaharatas ruled strictly before the
Kardamakas, but there was probably some overlap -- Nahapana was defeated
by Gautamiputra Satakarni, while Rudradaman (who was Chastana's
grandson) fought Gautamiputra's grandson Vashishtiputra Satakarni.

These Scythians grew very powerful on account of their alliances; they
were at complete peace with the Kushans, and they gave some daughters in
marriage to the Satavahanas. Well, a certain Satavahana emperor is known
to have accidentally killed his wife during intercourse[^22], so it is
no surprise that the latter alliance was a bit more unstable.

These Scythians were highly Sanskritized culturally, and were primarily
affected by Vedic political philosophy (although they also donated to
Buddhists) -- their inscriptions contain descriptions of the Purushartha
philosophy in pure Sanskrit, they issued land grants and kanyadanas to
Brahmins, held and participated in Swayamvaras, employed Brahmin
ministers, fought wild tribes and built infrastructure (especially
cisterns, which they held to be sacred), spared defeated rulers, etc.

They were also instrumental in the popularization of Greek astronomy in

**Background: start of the barbarian invasions**

Ashoka's authoritarian rule caused a tripartite division of the Mauryan
empire shortly after his death c. 232 BC -- the South seceded, and the
North split into two empires ruled from Pataliputra and Ujjain. The
political stability that Chanakya had created disappeared, and seven
different Mauryan kings ruled in the next 50 years, before the dynasty
was overthrown in a coup by Pushyamitra Shunga in 180 BC. The Shunga
empire, as well as the Satavahana empire in the Deccan, were not only
Vedic in their governance, their rulers were Brahmins by caste. The
political power that the Buddhists had gathered during Ashoka's reign
disappeared.

(There is a certain analogy between the Maurya-Gupta interregnum and the
Trump administration in the modern U.S. Here, Vedic philosophy is
analogous to conservatism, and Buddhism is analogous to the left. While
Vedic ideas were executed very efficiently, it became more of a big-tent
philosophy, compromising on ideological purity; furthermore, while
Vedism nominally won the battle in terms of *political* power,
Buddhism's *cultural* foothold only expanded.)

There is significant evidence that many politically influential Indian
Buddhists were complicit in the barbarian invasions; the Milinda Panha
describes Buddhist monks traveling to Central Asia to advise Menander I,
Pushyamitra Shunga is recorded to have executed several Buddhists in
Sakala for treason, and the Jains blame themselves (the Jain monk
Kalaka) for inviting the Scythians to invade India, probably an
appropriation of a Buddhist act (considering that the Jains were
themselves persecuted by Ashoka, and Kharavela, who repelled Menander
I's invasion, was a Jain). As many Buddhists had been appointed to
positions of political power under Ashoka and the same state
infrastructure continued to exist under the early Shungas, it seems
reasonable that they were capable of betraying the Shungas in some
critical way.

An alternate reading is that the Greeks fanned the civil war within the
Maurya empire to facilitate their invasion -- this reading is supported
by some supposed verses from texts called the *Parampara-pustaka* and
the *Yavanarajya-Vrttanta*[^23], but I was not able to find these
original texts, and I am doubtful of their authenticity.

**Background: 180 -- 57 BC**

Messy notions of sovereignty predate the Scythian invasion. The
Greco-Bactrian invaders themselves were highly decentralized into
several houses, etc. and their relationships with existing Indian rulers
were complicated (the latter were not deposed, but were also not on
friendly terms necessarily -- thus the state can only be described as
war).

Demetrius I was the first of these invaders, who made it only as far as
Taxila c. 180 BC. Several rulers are described in his immediate
succession, including Pantaleon, Agathocles, Antimachus I, Antimachus
II, Apollodotus I (it is unclear what their relationship was).

Apollodotus I was the most significant of these successors, who expanded
Southward to Sindh (where his coins are found). He may have also
attempted an invasion of Bharuch (as per the Periplus), but he was
probably repelled by the Satavahanas.

Taxila and other cities in Gandhara continued to mint coins in the
traditional Indian standard alongside Indo-Greek coins[^24] -- this
could suggest the existence of private coinage, but I find it more
likely that the Indo-Greek houses existed alongside local Indian
dynasties, and that these houses were adversarial to each other (as the
existence of competing coinage shows), rather than vassal or
allied[^25].

Menander I's invasion c. 160 BC was much more serious, and is discussed
extensively in Indian literature, such as in the fawning Buddhist
Milinda Panha, which states that he ruled from Sakala (Punjab); he also
certainly brought Taxila under his direct sovereign control, as local
Taxila coinage ceases in this period. Besides his possessions in the
Punjab region, though, his other expeditions are more confusing.

It is known that Menander launched a Gangetic campaign, with his army
reaching Pataliputra (some historians are skeptical of this invasion,
but it seems like obvious historical fact to me, corroborated by
multiple sources[^26]) -- however, this only amounted to a brief raid,
and the famed Kalinga hero Kharavela repelled him back to Mathura at
least.

In Mathura too, coins of local Indian rulers -- bearing names amounting
to the *Deva*, *Dutta* and *Mitra* dynasties -- are found uninterrupted
alongside Indo-Greek coins. However, Greek control over Mathura is also
described in Indian sources (e.g. the Yavanarajya inscription and
various Puranas, although interestingly the Milinda Panha makes no
mention of this).

There are some oft-quoted verses from the Vayu Purana 99.362, 99.383,
tertially attributed to a certain Morton Smith 1973:

*Asui dve ca varsani bhoktaro Yavana mahim*

*Mathuram ca purim ramyam Yauna bhoksyanti sapta vai*

I wasn't able to find these words in the Vayu Purana[^27], and I suspect
that it is a fabrication, even if the inference may be justified.

I was able to find:

*Thereafter, the untruthful and unrighteous Yavanas of great fury and
little grace will rule here spreading their religion, spending vast
riches and giving vent to their lust.*

*Those kings will not be duly crowned. They will have all the defects of
the Kali Yuga. They will commit evil actions.*

*During the remaining period of the Kali Yuga, the kings will enjoy the
Earth, not even hesitating to kill women and children and to destroy one
another.*

*They will be devoid of Dharma, Kama, Artha (righteousness, love,
wealth). All the common people coming into close contact with them, too
will follow the customs and habits of barbarians.*

*They will act contrary to accepted traditions. They will destroy their
subjects. The kings will be greedy and devoted to mendacious behaviour.*

*When their turn is over, women will outnumber men in that age. People
will become increasingly deficient in learning and strength. Their
lifespans will shrink.*

(Vayu Purana, translated by GV Tagare, Part 2, 37.382-289 / p. 820-821.)

It seems likely that Mathura and other densely populated regions may
have become a battlefield between Indian rulers and the Greeks without
enjoying a stable government -- much like Taxila had been during
Demetrius's invasion -- while the Punjab, including Taxila, had become a
core Greek territory under Menander I. It is also not clear what the
relationship between the Deva, Datta and Mitra dynasties was precisely:
there are several other Mitra dynasties that appear throughout the
Gangetic plain in Panchala, Kaushambi and Ayodhya -- it is possible
these may have been private merchants or the sort of plutocratic
governments mentioned in the Arthashastra and the Ashtadhyayi.

This "Mathura as a battlefield" hypothesis is also supported by the
extensive growth of fortifications in Mathura during this period; it's
also worth noting that the architecture and art of Mathura in this
period was *not* influenced by Greek styles, so governance was likely
predominantly Mitra, even if they may have had to pay tribute to the
Greeks[^29][^30].

As the Indo-Greeks were rarely a single unified state themselves (except
under some rulers like Demetrius and Menander), the kingdom fragmented
upon Menander's death c. 130 BC. These fragmented Indo-Greeks quickly
diminished in importance, paying tribute to Scythian invaders (where
special Greek coins are found[^31]) and to the Shunga empire (where
various Indo-Greeks donated several monuments, both of Vaishnava and
Buddhist sects).

The Ayudhajivi Sanghas (war-like republics/corporations) that ruled East
of the Ravi river rebelled c. 100 BC, ending Greek rule in Eastern
Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Northern Rajasthan -- notable among
these corporations are the Yaudheyas, Arjunayanas, Audumbaras, Kunindas,
Trigartas and Rajanyas. Their independence is known from the coins they
minted with legends like[^32]:

*Arjunayanam Jayah*

*Yaudheya Ganasaya Jayah*

![](../-attachments/stock%20photos/ayudhajivi.jpeg)

*Map of Ayudhajivi Sanghas*[^33]

They apparently remained allied against foreign invasions for several
centuries to come. See also[^34]. Also interesting to note: the
Yaudheyas were apparently followers of Skanda/Kartikeya, the Arjunayanas
were followers of Shiva, the Audambaras honored Sage Vishvamitra but
also followed Skanda and Shiva, the Kunindas followed a
Vaishnava-Buddhist syncretism like the Indo-Greeks.

The remaining Indo-Greek territories in the West (centered around
Taxila) were reunified under Philoxenus c. 100 BC, and then fragmented
again.

It was around this time that the conflict in Central Asia between the
Yuezhi and the Scythians boiled over into India, with one of them or
both apparently occupying Indo-Greek territories in Paropamisadae
(Western Gandhara and Kamboja), and the Indo-Greek king Hermaeus c. 80
BC is shown in conflict with these nomads.
