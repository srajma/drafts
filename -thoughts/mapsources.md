## North West

https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.4695/page/n77/mode/2up
The Agalassoi and Sibae were said to be North from the Malloi (Arrian says Alexander "made inroads" among them to prevent them from confluencing from the Malloi); the ?ibis are associated with U??nara in traditional literature, so I have located them at a region accessible to the Usinara.

The Ambastha are hard to locate from Indian literature, but the Diodorus helps locate them:

Some information based on Alexander's invasion:

### Cophen campaign

A people called Aspasioi are found in the Choes (either the Alishang or the Kunar) valley and a people called Assakenoi in the Swat Valley. The Guraeans ruled in the Panjkora valley of the Upper Dir district.

The Kunar Valley starts at Chitral, flows through the Kunar province of Afghanistan, and returns to Pakistan through the Khyber district, until Attock. 

The Swat Valley corresponds to the modern-day Swat district. The Assakenoi also controlled the Buner district, and the city of Aornos may have been on Pir Sar in the Shangla district. Pushkalavati, the former seat of Achaemenid power in Gandhara, located on the border of Charsadda and Peshawar, also likely came under their influence in this period.

https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=t5g2EAAAQBAJ&pg=PA24

The Guraeans seemed to have been vassals of the Aspasioi, as the city of Arigaion in Bajaur district is attributed to both of them (sorta).

Dodge, Theodore (1890). Alexander. Pennsylvania: Stackpole Books. p. 519.

Abisares was an ally of the Assakenoi, and ruled in Kashmir (including the Pakistan-controlled part shown in the map, and e.g. Rajouri in the India-controlled part).

The part of Ancient Gandhara not attributed to one of these tribes, I have attributed to Taxila.

### Hydapses campaign

Porus ruled between the Jhelum and the Chenab rivers.

A certain Glausaes ruled to his North-East.

To his South-East, between the Chenab and Ravi rivers, ruled "the other Porus", an enemy of Porus, possibly his cousin. 

Sakala was not part of this territory, instead belonging to the war-like Cathaeans who originated further East.

Arrian doesn't name the rulers of the territory between the Ravi and Beas rivers, but Diodorus states it was ruled by numerous divided states including Sophytes, Phegus, the Adrestians etc.

Bosworth, Albert Brian (1993). "From the Hydaspes to the Southern Ocean". Conquest and Empire: The Reign of Alexander the Great. Cambridge University Press.

Arrian, The Anabasis of Alexander, 5.21-22.

### Southern Punjab

Alexander subjugated some unnamed Indian states during his voyage down the Jhelum, probably located on its West bank. 

Arrian, The Anabasis of Alexander, 6.4.

He then traveled down the Chenab. Here too, several unnamed rulers refused to submit to him. Interestingly, Arrian does not describe battles with these rulers, instead merely saying that Alexander prevented them from aiding the Malloi further South (who were preparing for battle against Alexander).

Arrian, The Anabasis of Alexander, 6.5.

At the intersection of the Ravi and the Chenab was where the next described battle takes place. The Malloi ruled directly South of this confluence, and I assume that this corresponds to the modern-day Multan division (i.e. as far as the Sutlej-Chenab confluence).

The Malloi allied with the Oxydraci, their historical enemies. Their territory is not known. However, I will note that Arrian does not mention any battles between the Sutlej-Chenab confluence and the Chenab-Indus Confluence, thus I assume this region belonged to the Oxydraci.

### Sindh

Musicanus and Oxycanus were likely plains-dwelling rulers in Sindh. Sambus likely had a more mountainous territory in the Western part of Sindh. Patala was a kingdom in the Sindh river delta.

## Foreign realms

### Note on Central Asia and foreign realms

There are several different genres of traditional Indian literature on foreign realms, especially on Central Asia, ordered from most grounded-in-reality to most poeticized: 

* Merchants' tales. Although we know from the history of those regions that Hinduism played equal part in the Indian influences on Central Asia and South-East Asia, its orthodox literature speaks relatively little on trade in realistic terms compared to the Jain texts from the early centuries AD (Angavijja, Vasudeva-hindi, Antagadadasao etc.) and Buddhist texts from the Pali Canon or from the same time period (Mahaniddesa, Mahavastu, the Jatakas). With that said Hindu texts like the Mahabharata's Sabha-Parva and the Brihatkatha of South Indian origin are also useful. Most of these primary sources are hard to find, I have mostly relied on the secondary source, Moti Chandra's "Trade and Trade Routes in Ancient India"
* The "Uttara- Parama-" countries. Uttara-kuru, Uttara-madra, Parama-kamboja ... these are very difficult to identify. Uttara-kuru is the most prominent of these: in time of the Aitreya Brahmana (earlier than 500 BC) it was apparently a historical place, but by the time of the Puranas and Buddhist literature it had taken a mythical role as a paradise of "noble savages" (it was praised as gloriously wealthy, yet nomadic, "suitable only for pleasure, not work" i.e. not a Karmabhumi, sexual frivolousness and absence of marriage)
* The Puranic "Mount Meru" cosmology. Real mountain ranges and rivers are idealized into a particular geometric model. Various kingdoms are named in these regions, but they are inconsistent and hard to identify because the Puranas were composed over a long time period, and because they are given mythical traits (e.g. the Kimpurusas having "horse-shaped heads").
* The Puranic "dvipas of Bharatavarsa" cosmology. Indradvipa, Kaseruman, Tamraparna, Gabhastiman, Nagadvipa, Saumya, Gandharva, Varuna. Some have suggested associations like Varuna = Borneo, Tamraparna = Sri Lanka, but these seem arbitrary to me, and it's likely just an idealization of regions in South-East Asia.
* The Puranic "dvipa/Seven Continents" cosmology. Only Jambudvipa is real, and refers to the entire physical world, all others are vaguely based on regions of Central Asia (e.g. claiming that the Magi were the Brahmins of Shakadvipa).

The absence of a standardized name for Sogdia in Indian literature is certainly surprising given the close relationship between India and the region (c.f. the Buddhist monk Kumarajiva), although it is referenced often in Chinese Buddhist literature. This list in the Jain Antagadadasao, of sources of women in a harem in Dvaraka, is illuminating:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/qsF2u.png [source](https://archive.org/details/antagadadasaoanu17royauoft/page/28/mode/2up)

> Kirata women ... women of Babbara, Pausaya, Greek, Pahlavaya, Isinaya, Caruinaya, Lasaya, Lausaya, Dravidian, Sinhalese, Arab, Pulinda, Pakkana, Bahala, Marunda, Sabara, and the Persian race, women of diverse lands, in foreign garb, with raiment taken from their own countries' fashions, understanding from gesture what was thought and desired from them

Dravidian, Sinhalese, Pulinda, Sabara are Indian nations; Bahala is Bactria of course, Pahlavaya is the Parthians, Babbara is probably Somalia, and Pakkana might be Ferghana. Pausaya, Isinaya, Caruinaya, Lasaya, Lausaya, Marunda are hard to identify, but Moti Chandra suggests they are places in the trans-Oxus country i.e. Sogdia, Margiana etc:

> The list of the foreign female slaves in the Antagaaadasao is also interesting as it informs us that they came from the trans-Oxus country, Ferghana, Sri Lanka, Arabia, Balkh, Iran etc., and employed in the harems for service.

## Note on South-East Asia

The places labelled in the Sea Routes map are only those mentioned in the literature of India proper (that too mostly in the Gupta period or earlier). Obviously Indian colonization in South-East Asia in the post-Gupta period touched nearly every region of South-East Asia, with Chola-descended princes ruling even as far as the Philippines, but the names of these local kingdoms are not mapped here because that is the history of an entire civilization (of South-East Asia) in itself, and out of our scope.

### Identifications of rivers in Central Asia

The Puranas mention that four rivers originate out of Sumeru, but they are oddly identified as the Sita, Ganga, Indus, Oxus. The myth is reflected in Buddhist literature which specifies that these rivers proceed from the North, East, South and West of the "Anavatapta lake" respectively. 

https://www.wisdomlib.org/buddhism/book/maha-prajnaparamita-sastra/d/doc225128.html

It seems likely that Sita was used to refer to multiple rivers, including the Syr Darya and the Tarim, see note here:

https://www.wisdomlib.org/south-asia/book/buddhist-records-of-the-western-world-xuanzang/d/doc220145.html#note-e-86548

E.g. the Brahmanda Purana suggests the river flows Westward, which would contradict being the Tarim river.

https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brahmanda-purana/d/doc362834.html

https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brahmanda-purana/d/doc362725.html#note-t-125584

But the Mahabharata suggests that the Sailoda flows between the Meru and Mandara ranges, and Mandara seems to be an alternate nae for the Tian-shan, making that the Syr Daria. The Mandara has also instead been identified as the Alay range:

https://www.wisdomlib.org/history/compilation/list-of-mahabharata-tribes/d/doc117017.html

But I think this is unlikely because Mandara is said to be Eastward of Meru (Alay is the Westward projection of the Pamirs), and there is also no river valley of significance "between the Pamir and Alay" (Bactria lies between Pamir/Alay and the Hindu Kush).
