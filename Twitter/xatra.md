The idea is you specify a map by a list of "flags": declarations that a certain polity ruled over some region. A Minimal Working Example of how you would use the package:

It's not the prettiest, and its handling of dynamic (year-wise) maps is currently quite inefficient. I would be *very* happy to have some collaborators:

For the time being, it at least simplifies things compared to editing in inkscape for hours on end.
